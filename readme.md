First of all you guys need to have pre installed

Node js
Postgresql

To start setting things up here are your steps:

 1) open the file called db.sql inside the database folder, inside this file you need to copy the first line
 
 2) open the SQL Shell of postgresql

 3) Paste the line we previously copied inside the SQL Shell

 4) copy the rest of the code inside of db.sql and paste it inside the SQL shell

After this is done, everything should be up to go

To start using the app you should use the terminal inside each frontend and backend folder

Inside the Backend folder you should run this command

    npm start
